![a9s demo](docs/demos/demo.gif)

Browse, inspect, and manage 62 AWS resource types from your terminal. a9s gives you a real-time, keyboard-driven interface to your AWS infrastructure -- no clicking through the console, no memorizing CLI flags.

**Read-only by design.** a9s never makes write calls to AWS. Safe to use in production. Write operations are on the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) only after the project has proven itself as a trusted tool (10k+ stars).

**No credential storage.** a9s never reads `~/.aws/credentials`. Authentication is delegated entirely to the AWS SDK's credential chain.

**No telemetry.** a9s never phones home.

**Try without AWS.** Run `a9s --demo` to explore the full UI with synthetic data — no AWS account needed.
